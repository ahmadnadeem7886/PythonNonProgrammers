# Functions and Recursion

## Function

A function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.

Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable. Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable any number of time.

### Syntax

```{python, error=TRUE, include=TRUE}
def function_name(parameters):
	"""docstring"""
	statement(s)
```

Above shown is a function definition that consists of the following components.

-   Keyword **`def`** that marks the start of the function header.

-   A function name to uniquely identify the function. Function naming follows the same rules of writing identifiers in Python.

-   Parameters (`arguments`) through which we pass values to a function. They are optional.

-   A colon (:) to mark the end of the function header.

-   Optional documentation string (doc string) to describe what the function does.

-   One or more valid python statements that make up the function body. Statements must have the same indentation level (usually 4 spaces).

-   The statement `return` exits a function, optionally passing back a value..

### Example

```{python}
def greet(name):
  '''Greeting Function'''
  print("Welcome to the World of Python, " +name)
greet("Raja")
```

### Quick Quiz

1.  Define a function to return the absolute value of the entered number.

2.  Define a function to day Hello, good morning "name", if the person in your contact list, otherwise ask "Who are You"

## Type of functions

Basically, we can divide functions into the following two types:

1.  `Built-in functions` - Functions that are built into Python.

2.  `User-defined functions` - Functions defined by the users themselves.

For example, len( ), range ( ) and print( ) are `built-in functions`, and the `greet function` defined above is a `user-defined function`.

## Functions with arguments

```{python}
def greet1(name,msg):
  print("Hello", name +', '+msg)
greet1('ahmad', 'how are you')
```

Here, the function `greet1()` has two parameters.

Since we have called this function with two arguments, it runs smoothly and we do not get any error.

If we call it with a different number of arguments, the interpreter will show an error message. Below is a call to this function with one and no arguments along with their respective error messages.

```{python, error=TRUE, include=TRUE}
def greet1(name,msg):
  print("Hello", name +', '+msg)
greet1('ahmad')
```

## Default argument or parameter value

Function **arguments** can have **default values** in Python. We can provide a default value to an argument by **using the assignment operator (=)**. Here is an example.

```{python}
def greet1(name ,msg="How do you do"):
  print("Hello", name +', '+msg)
greet1('Ahmad')
```

The input to a function is called a formal parameter.

A variable that is declared inside a function is called a **local variable**. The parameter only exists within the function (i.e. the point where the function starts and stops).

A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout the program.

```{python}
def square(a): # formal parameter
  '''
  This function will return the sqaure of number plus 1
  
  '''
  b = 1 # local variable
  c = a*a + b
  return c

print(square(2))
  
```

## Recursive function

Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself. That is, a function that calls itself. For example:

`factorial(n)=n * factorial(n-1)`

### Example:

```{python}
#n! = 1*2*3*...*n
n=3
product = 1
for i in range(n):
  product = product*(i+1)
print(product)
```

### Return Values

The Python return statement is a **special statement that you can use inside a function or method to send the function's result back to the caller**. To let a function return a value, use the return statement:

above example can be wrapped in a function as:

```{python}
def fact(n):
  product = 1
  for i in range(n):
    product=product*(i+1)
  return product
print(fact(3))
```

Using Recursion

```{python}
def recur_factorial(n):
    """This is a recursive function
    to find the factorial of an integer"""
    if n==1:
        return 1
    else:
        return (n*recur_factorial(n-1))


print(recur_factorial(3))
```

## Pre-defined Functions

There are many pre-defined functions in Python, so let's start with the simple ones.

The `print()` function:

```{python}
# Build-in function print()

list1 = [10.0, 8.5, 9.5, 7.0, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 9.5] 
print(list1)
```

The `sum()` function adds all the elements in a list or tuple: try pease

The `len()` function show the length a list or tuple: try please

## Exceptions

An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of code. This error causes the code to raise an exception and if not prepared to handle it will halt the execution of the code.

### Exampls

Run each piece of code and observe the exception raised

```{python, error=TRUE, include=TRUE}
1/0
y = a+5
a = [1,2,3]
a[5]

```

## Exercise_Functions

1.  Create a function `con` that add two number .

2.  Can the `con` function we defined before be used to concatenate lists or tuples?

3.  Write a function named odd_or_zero which takes one parameter, a number, and returns that number if it is odd or returns 0 if the number is even. Then using a list comprehension which iterates over a_list and calls your odd or zero function for each value, print a list like the following: `[ 1, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 7, 0, 9, 0 ]`

4.  Define a function to find the greatest of three numbers using.

5.  How do you prevent python print( ) function to print a new line at the end.

6.  Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of first n natural numbers.

7.  Write a function to print first n lines of the following pattern.\
    \*\*\*\*\****\
    \*\*\***\
    *\*

8.  Write a function which converts inches in cm

9.  Write a function to remove a given word from a string and strip it at the same time.

10. Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list. Sample List : `[1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]`, Unique List :`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
